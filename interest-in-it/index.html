                        <h1>Interest in IT - <i>Sunil Rodrigues</i></h1>
                        <div>
                            <p>My interest in personal computers started as a 22 year old in 1989, when I was working with Balancing Machines in India. We used to have a Schneck Avery Balancing machine that we used to balance aircraft engine rotors. This machine has a minicomputer that would record the results and output them to a printer.  In those days the PC were very crude, and you had to do manual connections and manipulations, which were done by only a single person in the company. No one else was allowed to touch these. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>So when I came to Australia, I ended by buying a second hand PC in running Windows 3. It had a 5.25 Floppy disk drive and hard drive.  The person who sold this PC told me to contact him if anything went wrong. This was a sort of warranty. This PC would break so often and after a few visits to him, both of us got fed up. He trained me in how to do basic things. This started my work in IT. I would open things and add more memory, drives, cards, some even were not necessary. I would go to swap meets and grab items that I could salvage parts off. I was single and had all the time in the world to do this. This was the beginning of my journey and slowly as time progressed, I began to learn more on how to setup these devices.</p>
                        <br>
                            <p>Fast forward a few years, spent a large portion of my working career in Maintenance, Planning, Engineering and Reliability. We had a lot of systems to manage maintenance but these were separate entities and data transfers was manual. So with the help of a consultant I started designing an application that would tie things together making it easier for the maintenance crew. This was built in Microsoft Access with VBA scripting.  I managed to learn scripting and solely built my first application to monitor wear on Reciprocating Compressors. That was the start of building applications for me. 
                            I learnt new skills and passed on these skills to the people that worked for me. In 1999, while working for a Mining company I got involved in the implementation of SAP. This application was huge with a wide range of possibilities. You could configure this the way you wanted to work, customise transactions and customise reports. I got books on SAP and self-thought into various aspects of the system. I ended up getting  SAP Certified Plant Maintenance Consultant in ERP6.0 certification.</p> 
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <div>
                            <p>The last 13 years I have been leading a team to build data for a mining operation. Traditionally this work is done by a large team, but given the global financial crisis combined with mining industry boom, the teams were cut down. Hence I realised that if we are to build good data, we have to rely on good systems to record, check, verify, load data. So we had to build some applications to support us. In my team I had a software engineer who would build and maintain these applications. In recent years with cost cutting, I ended up losing this resource and the work that this resource would do was farmed offshore. This work had to be packaged, documented and sent offshore. While the people offshore would do their bit, it often would fall over when it came to other items in the process that they did not look after. I realised that it was not just the programming but the hardware, the software, networking, storage, security that as a whole needed to be robust to make most things work well. Being the custodian of the maintenance applications, I had ensure these system were available at all times and running optimally. This made me realise the importance of having a wider knowledge of the whole bigger picture and grew my interest in this topic.  After years of thinking about it, I made the decision to start learning and upskilling myself in this field. 
                            I researched where I could upskill myself and my initial view was to do a few courses in different topics. I work full time and hence the only option for me was to do online education.  Just like most things happen in our life, one day while browsing, I came across this online university and stumbled upon the course for Bachelor of Information Technology. This sounded good as I could do my units progressively. Three days later I was enrolled.</p></div>
                        <br> 
                            <p>For me, my expectations are to start from the basics working towards building my skills as I progress along.  The key skills I would want to master are coding, programming, networking, storage and cloud computing, security, Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things.</p>
