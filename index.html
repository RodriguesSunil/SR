                                    <p>Welcome to my page. You are browsing through the pages of Sunil Rodrigues, student ID s3923382.  
                                        I came across from India in 1992 as a single young 25 year old through the skilled migration category. Living in Australia was quite different from where I came from, but it was great enjoying the county, the people and the open spaces.  My first place in Australia was St Mary’s in Sydney, living with friends and enjoying the single life.

                                        In India, I completed my training in an Oil Refinery and then travelled most of the country, oil rigs and commercial ships working. I went to Kuwait just after the war with Iraq with work and that is when my visa to move to Australia was granted.

                                        Back here in Australia, I started working at Syndey Water, looking after the maintenance of their water assets. Over time I implemented various strategies to improve maintenance. Likewise in India, even here work took me places and ended up in Port Hedland WA working for the BHP in their very first Hot Briquette Iron Plant. I lived and worked in Port Hedland for 7 years until the place shut down after an unfortunate accident.  For those that do not know, Port Hedland is a major Iron Ore town. Everything is covered in red dirt. You never buy white clothes when you live there. They become red. It has Australia’s largest bulk export Port.

                                        I moved to Perth in 2005 and have lived here since then. I still work for a Mining company and have worked there for the last 13 years looking after their Maintenance Systems or collectively known as CMMS (Computerised Maintenance Management Systems)

                                        I have done my Post Graduate Diploma in Engineering Maintenance Management through Monash University and over the years have acquired various skills. I am  SAP Certified Plant Maintenance Consultant in ERP6.0. I worked on four SAP implementations in the last 21 years.  Over the last three years, I have been working at improvements in the way we use our maintenance applications and made up my mind to get a structured education in this field.

                                        When you are from India it is a given the Cricket will be the favourite sport. It is true with me. I love cricket and can spend a whole day sitting and watching a game of cricket.  Test cricket is my favourite. If I am walking the dog and there is a cricket match going on in the park, I will stop and watch. Lucky to have 2 countries I can call home, Australia and India and both these countries are very good in Cricket.

                                        I have a wife, 2 kids and a dog. Dogs are my favourite pet. He is a Tiboodle who is 4 years now. He is adorable and smart. He looks after me. He wakes me up, keeps me healthy by asking for walks and makes me feel guilty when I am eating snacks by staring at me. Pets do keep you active, so if you do not have one get one.
